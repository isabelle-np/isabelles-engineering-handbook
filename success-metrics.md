# Engineering Excellence Charter Success Metrics

This document defines success metrics for my Engineering Excellence Charter.  
These metrics are intended to make my principles observable, measurable, and actionable.

They are signals, not targets to game. I value trends, context, and judgment over raw numbers.

## 1. User Value & Outcomes  

### Quantitative Signals
- Percentage of roadmap items with a documented user problem and success metric before implementation
- Adoption, engagement, or task-completion metrics tied to shipped features
- Time from feature release to validated learning (data, feedback, or decision)

### Qualitative Indicators
- I can clearly articulate who a feature is for and why it exists
- Product and engineering discussions reference user impact, not just delivery status

## 2. Code Health & Craftsmanship

### Quantitative Signals
- Trends in code quality indicators (linting, static analysis, meaningful test coverage)
- Ratio of refactoring / maintenance work to net-new feature work
- Mean time to understand or safely change a component (via onboarding or reviews)

### Qualitative Indicators
- Code reviews emphasize clarity, design, and maintainability
- I feel confident making changes in unfamiliar areas of the codebase

## 3. Architectural Clarity & Problem Understanding

### Quantitative Signals
- Percentage of significant initiatives with a documented problem statement and design rationale
- Number of design reviews conducted before large or irreversible decisions
- Reduction in rework caused by unclear requirements or premature tooling choices

### Qualitative Indicators
- I consistently ask “why” and challenge assumptions constructively
- Architecture discussions focus on tradeoffs and constraints, not just solutions

## 4. System Reliability & Scalability Balance  
*(Holistic Systems Thinking)*

### Quantitative Signals
- Service-level indicators (availability, latency, error rates) meeting defined targets
- Frequency and severity of incidents caused by known design shortcuts
- Cost-to-serve trends as usage scales

### Qualitative Indicators
- Speed vs. scalability tradeoffs are explicitly discussed during planning
- Incidents lead to learning and system improvements, not blame

## 5. Collaboration & Quality Bar

### Quantitative Signals
- Percentage of changes reviewed by at least one peer
- Cross-team participation in design reviews or technical RFCs
- Cycle time from PR open to merge (balanced—not optimized at the expense of quality)

### Qualitative Indicators
- Feedback is timely, respectful, and focused on improving outcomes
- Shared ownership is visible; knowledge is not siloed

## 6. Leadership, Empathy & Enablement

### Quantitative Signals
- Time to unblock teams after risks or impediments are raised
- Clarity of goals (via alignment surveys or retrospectives)
- Engineering retention and engagement trends

### Qualitative Indicators
- Engineers feel safe raising concerns and proposing ideas
- I am perceived as removing friction, not adding process
- Teams understand expectations and what “great execution” looks like

## 7. Delivery Speed with Sustainability

### Quantitative Signals
- Lead time from idea to production
- Deployment frequency paired with stability metrics
- Burnout indicators (after-hours work, incident fatigue)

### Qualitative Indicators
- Teams feel they can move quickly without sacrificing quality
- Deadlines are met without recurring heroics

## How I Use These Metrics

- I review trends, not snapshots
- I balance metrics; no single metric is optimized in isolation
- I pair numbers with narratives; retrospectives and reviews provide context
- I continuously refine; metrics evolve as teams and systems mature
