# Scenario Planning Example: “Improving My Dog’s Experience While I’m at Work”

This example demonstrates how I apply product management skills to improving my dog's experience while I am away at the office.

## Context

I want to improve the well-being and happiness of my dog while I am at work. Key uncertainties include:

- How my dog reacts to being alone
- Which interventions will meaningfully improve their experience
- Cost, time, and effort to implement potential solutions

I approach this like a product problem: identify problems, explore options, test, and iterate.

## Step 1: Define the Core Question

> What can I do to make my dog feel happy, safe, and engaged while I am away at work?

## Step 2: Identify Key Uncertainties

1. Dog Engagement Level  
   - High: dog stays content alone  
   - Low: dog experiences anxiety or boredom

2. Effectiveness of Interventions  
   - High: intervention works as intended  
   - Low: intervention fails to meaningfully improve experience

These uncertainties create four plausible scenarios.

## Step 3: Map the Scenarios

### Scenario A: High Engagement + High Effectiveness

What happens  
- Dog is relaxed and entertained while I am away  
- Interventions such as toys, puzzle feeders, dog cameras, or a dog-walking service work perfectly

Signals I watch  
- Calm behavior, no excessive barking or destructive behavior  
- Happy body language when I return  
- Use of enrichment tools

My response  
- Standardize the successful interventions  
- Monitor periodically to ensure consistency  
- Consider scaling, for example sharing setup tips with friends or dog community

### Scenario B: High Engagement + Low Effectiveness

What happens  
- Dog is content naturally  
- Expensive or complex interventions do not add measurable benefit

Signals I watch  
- Dog is relaxed, ignores extra toys or cameras  
- No improvement in happiness metrics from baseline

My response  
- Simplify or reduce interventions  
- Focus resources on other priorities  
- Avoid overengineering the solution

### Scenario C: Low Engagement + High Effectiveness

What happens  
- Dog is anxious or bored when alone  
- Interventions meaningfully improve mood and engagement

Signals I watch  
- Reduced signs of anxiety such as less chewing, barking, pacing  
- Increased engagement with enrichment items  
- Positive changes in behavior over time

My response  
- Standardize successful interventions  
- Experiment with additional complementary options such as dog walker or scheduled video calls  
- Track engagement to iterate and optimize

### Scenario D: Low Engagement + Low Effectiveness

What happens  
- Dog is stressed while alone  
- Interventions fail to improve experience

Signals I watch  
- Persistent anxiety behaviors  
- Negative reactions to enrichment or monitoring tools  
- Increased health or behavioral issues

My response  
- Reevaluate assumptions about the dog's needs  
- Explore alternative solutions such as dog daycare, neighbor visits, or longer walks before leaving  
- Test interventions iteratively in smaller steps

## Step 4: Define Triggers

- Anxiety indicators such as barking more than 15 minutes, destructive behavior, or pacing  
- Engagement signals such as use of toys, interacting with cameras, or relaxed posture  
- Time-of-day patterns such as mornings versus afternoons

## Step 5: Align Resources

- Tools: puzzle toys, automated feeders, dog cameras  
- Services: dog walker, doggy daycare, neighbor visits  
- Schedule: testing and iterating on different combinations

## Why This Shows Product Management Skills

- Problem framing: I defined the problem and constraints clearly  
- Hypothesis-driven thinking: Each scenario has signals, interventions, and expected outcomes  
- Decision framework: I have pre-planned responses based on observed signals  
- Iterative experimentation: Scenarios allow me to learn and adjust without guessing  
- Resource prioritization: I evaluate interventions based on impact versus effort
