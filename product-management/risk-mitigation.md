# Risk Assessment — My Dog’s Well-Being

This risk assessment identifies potential risks to my dog’s happiness, health, and engagement while I am at work. Each risk is evaluated for likelihood and consequence severity, with mitigation strategies for both.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Consequence Severity | Overall Risk | Mitigation Strategies |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Separation anxiety leading to destructive behavior | Medium | High | High | **Likelihood mitigation:** Gradually increase alone time, positive reinforcement training. **Consequence mitigation:** Use chew-safe toys, secure environment, and dog-proof sensitive areas. |
| Low engagement with enrichment tools | Medium | Medium | Medium | **Likelihood mitigation:** Rotate toys and puzzle feeders frequently, test different engagement methods. **Consequence mitigation:** Add interactive play before leaving, use treat-dispensing devices to maintain stimulation. |
| Overstimulation or stress from too many interventions | Low | Medium | Low-Medium | **Likelihood mitigation:** Introduce new toys or activities gradually. **Consequence mitigation:** Monitor stress signals and remove overstimulating items if necessary. |
| Health issues due to insufficient exercise | Medium | High | High | **Likelihood mitigation:** Schedule daily walks and exercise routines. **Consequence mitigation:** Engage a dog walker if I am unavailable, monitor energy levels and adjust activity accordingly. |
| Negative interactions with other dogs or people | Low | Medium | Low-Medium | **Likelihood mitigation:** Supervised socialization, positive reinforcement during interactions. **Consequence mitigation:** Avoid high-risk situations, use leash or controlled environment when needed. |
| Illness or injury while alone | Low | High | Medium-High | **Likelihood mitigation:** Ensure a safe environment, remove hazards, maintain regular vet check-ups. **Consequence mitigation:** Access to emergency contact info, dog camera to monitor, and plan for quick veterinary access. |
| Lack of consistency in routine | Medium | Medium | Medium | **Likelihood mitigation:** Create a structured daily schedule and stick to it consistently. **Consequence mitigation:** Use reminders, automated feeders, and scheduled walks to maintain routine. |

## Risk Scoring Guide

- Likelihood: Low, Medium, High  
- Consequence Severity: Low, Medium, High  
- Overall Risk: Based on combined likelihood and consequence severity

## Key Takeaways

- Focus on high-risk items first: separation anxiety, insufficient exercise, and illness/injury  
- Mitigation strategies should address both reducing likelihood and reducing consequence severity  
- Regular monitoring and iteration are essential to maintain well-being and adapt to changing circumstances
