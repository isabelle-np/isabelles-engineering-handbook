# Product Management Portfolio: Dog Lifestyle Case Studies

In my current role as an Engineering Manager, I also fulfill the responsibilities of a Product Manager due to the absence of a dedicated PM on my team. I own the team roadmap (tracked in ProductPlan), define and track KPIs, and identify high-impact initiatives that align with business and customer goals. I partner closely with stakeholders across engineering, product, UX, and marketing/sales to ensure alignment and clarity, and I manage cross-functional initiatives through successful, on-time delivery. In parallel, I build and maintain strong relationships across the organization to enable effective collaboration and empower product teams to execute at a high level.

This directory demonstrates my product management skills through practical, real-world examples using the context of my dog, Orzo. Each example showcases core PM skills including problem framing, criteria definition, competitive analysis, tradeoff assessment, scenario planning, risk management, and data-driven decision-making.

## Scenario Planning Example

**Scenario:** Improving the experience of my dog while I am away at work.

- Objective: Maximize engagement, comfort, and well-being for my dog during office hours.
- Key Considerations: Enrichment, exercise, food routines, mental stimulation, monitoring.
- Steps Taken:
  1. Identify potential scenarios (boredom, anxiety, lack of engagement).  
  2. Develop preventive strategies (toys, puzzle feeders, regular exercise).  
  3. Monitor outcomes via cameras or check-ins.  
  4. Iterate based on feedback and observation.

> PM Skills Highlighted: Scenario planning, proactive problem-solving, experimentation, iteration.

## Strategic Planning Example

Objective: Optimize overall lifestyle and well-being for my dog in alignment with owner routines.

- Steps: 
  1. Define vision and success criteria for dog happiness and health.  
  2. Assess constraints: apartment size, urban environment, activity level, climate.  
  3. Identify opportunities: exercise, socialization, enrichment, training.  
  4. Prioritize initiatives and develop phased plan.  
  5. Measure success via engagement, health, and behavior metrics.

> PM Skills Highlighted: Vision setting, strategic alignment, prioritization, goal definition.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Objective: Identify potential risks to dog well-being and implement mitigation strategies.

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Separation anxiety | Medium | High | Gradual alone-time training, chew-safe toys, positive reinforcement |
| Low engagement | Medium | Medium | Rotate toys, interactive feeders, pre-departure play |
| Health issues (exercise) | Medium | High | Scheduled walks, dog walker, monitor energy levels |
| Illness or injury | Low | High | Safe environment, vet access, monitoring |

> PM Skills Highlighted: Risk identification, mitigation planning, likelihood vs. consequence assessment.

## Competitive Analysis of Dog Breeds

Objective: Identify the best dog breed for an active couple in an urban Mid-Atlantic environment with access to green space, light hiking, medium size preference, social personality, and low-maintenance grooming.

| Breed | Activity | City Adaptability | Hikes | Personality | Grooming | Size | Social | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-------|------------|---------|------|--------|------|
| Corgi | High | Excellent | Good | Bold, social, playful | Low | Medium | Excellent | Top choice |
| Labrador | High | Good | Excellent | Friendly | Moderate | Large | Excellent | Secondary choice |
| Vizsla | Very High | Moderate | Excellent | Affectionate | Low | Medium | Excellent | Secondary choice |
| Border Collie | Very High | Moderate | Excellent | Intelligent | Moderate | Medium | Good | Requires high engagement |

> PM Skills Highlighted: Problem framing, criteria definition, competitive evaluation, tradeoff assessment, recommendation.

## Summary

Through these examples, I demonstrate core product management skills applied to real-world decision-making:

- Strategic thinking and vision setting  
- Scenario planning and risk management  
- Defining clear evaluation criteria and metrics  
- Conducting competitive and quantitative analysis  
- Making data-driven recommendations  
- Collaboration and accountability  

Each exercise illustrates my ability to frame problems, prioritize tradeoffs, and communicate decisions effectively, combining my strategic thinking with engineering experience and formal systems engineering education.
