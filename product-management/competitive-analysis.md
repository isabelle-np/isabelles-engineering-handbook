# Dog Breed Weighted Scoring Matrix

This matrix evaluates dog breeds for an active couple living in an urban Mid-Atlantic region with access to green space, light hiking, medium size preference, social personality, low-maintenance grooming, and apartment-friendly living.

## Step 1: Define Criteria and Weights

| Criterion | Weight (%) | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Size | 15 | Medium size (not too big or small) |
| City Adaptability | 15 | Comfortable living in apartment/city environment |
| Activity / Hike Friendliness | 20 | Can handle light hikes and outdoor activity |
| Temperament / Personality | 20 | Social, friendly, engaging |
| Grooming / Care | 15 | Low-maintenance grooming (shedding acceptable) |
| Social / Companionship | 10 | Bonds well, enjoys human interaction |
| Climate Tolerance | 5 | Comfortable in Mid-Atlantic weather (hot summers, humid, mild winters) |

Weights total = 100%

## Step 2: Assign Scores (1-5)

- 1 = Poor fit  
- 5 = Excellent fit  

| Breed | Size (15) | City Adaptability (15) | Activity / Hikes (20) | Personality (20) | Grooming (15) | Social (10) | Climate (5) | Weighted Score |
|-------|------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Corgi | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4.75 |
| Labrador Retriever | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4.25 |
| Vizsla | 4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 4.35 |
| Border Collie | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.05 |
| Australian Shepherd | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.05 |
| Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.0 |
| Norwegian Buhund | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4.15 |
| Jack Russell Terrier | 2 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3.75 |
| Siberian Husky | 2 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 3.25 |

## Step 3: Analysis

- Climate Consideration: The Mid-Atlantic has hot, humid summers and mild winters. Breeds like Huskies may struggle in summer heat, while Corgis, Labs, and Vizslas handle the climate reasonably well.  
- Top Choice: Corgi (4.75) — medium-sized, apartment-friendly, social, low-maintenance grooming, enjoys moderate activity, and tolerates Mid-Atlantic climate.  
- Secondary Choices: Vizsla and Labrador Retriever, balancing activity, companionship, and climate tolerance, though Vizsla may need extra heat precautions in summer.

## Step 4: Product Management Skills Demonstrated

- Problem Framing: Incorporated environmental context into breed selection (Mid-Atlantic climate)  
- Criteria Weighting: Adjusted weights to reflect climate as an important factor  
- Tradeoff Analysis: Balanced size, activity, grooming, social personality, and climate suitability  
- Data-Driven Recommendation: Quantitative scoring to justify Corgi as top choice  
- Presentation: Structured, PM-style framework for decision-making
