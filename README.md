## About this Project

This idea came about as I decided to revive my 13-inch 2015 MacBook Pro from the depths of my closet. I started my M.S. in Systems Engineering program at Johns Hopkins University, and I wanted a portable workspace for coding, creating models for MBSE, homework, and studying. Even after 10 years, a fresh factory reset was all we needed to hit the ground running together.

As a software engineer, and especially in the age of AI-enablement, documentation is absolutely essential, even for a team of one. I actually learned this from my dad when I transitioned into software engineering from UX/UI design. As a former IT professional, his advice to me was: nobody likes writing documentation, so make sure you're the one doing it. Dad, you were right. 

Writing documentation is cumbersome. You have to write it, edit it, share it, maintain it, explain it, update it... you're never truly "done" with writing docs. Even with tools like GitHub CoPilot, Cursor, ChatGPT, etc., documentation requires effort (especially **really** good docs). With a strategy and some TLC, docs can be the easiest medium for scaling knowledge transfer, quality assurance, and collaboration with other people and tools.

Sure, you could just read code and figure out what it does, or even ask an AI agent to explain it! But there's quite a bit of context that isn't always evident:

- Why are things architected in the way that they are?
- What considerations and constraints informed the current architecture?
- What requirements led to this specific implementation?
- How tightly or loosely is this code coupled to the overall system?
- How mature is the system and how mature are each of the individual parts?
- What trade-offs were made?

As an engineering systems architect, all of this context is crucial to ensure that I'm building, maintaining, scaling, and even retiring robust, complex, and agile software systems. This context helps me build in the current reality: what can I actually do that will deliver the biggest impact to my users and stakeholders? 

I hope this project gives you insight into how I approach systems, documentation, and how I lead my engineers. I'm always learning, so I'll continue to iterate in this space with successes, lessons learned, and tips and tricks (and put to test some documentation self-governance!)
