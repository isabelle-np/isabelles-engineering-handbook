# About Me

## Engineering Leader Building AI-Driven Developer Experience Platforms

I architect intelligent platforms that transform how engineers work. With a unique blend of systems thinking, rapid prototyping capabilities, and human-centered AI design, I create production-ready tools with measurable organizational impact.

## What Makes Me Different

**Systems Thinker with User-Centered Focus**  
My background combines systems engineering (MS in progress, 4.0 GPA) with two years as a UX/UI designer before transitioning to seven years in software engineering. This distinctive path enables me to approach technical architecture with holistic systems thinking while maintaining unwavering focus on user needs. I don't just deploy tools, I design AI-augmented experiences grounded in user research, validated through continuous feedback loops, and measured with concrete success metrics.

**Data-Driven Decision Maker**  
I rigorously assess organizational requirements, conduct market research, establish objective success criteria aligned to Engineering OKRs and Product KPIs, and validate solutions through systematic pilots. This approach has helped me avoid hype-driven decisions and vendor lock-in while securing stakeholder buy-in for strategic initiatives. When I discovered similar initiatives across different teams, I facilitated cross-functional alignment that led to increased budget and coordinated rollout.

**Technical Architect & Strategic Communicator**  
As a subject matter expert authoring 10+ Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and Request for Comments (RFC) on our Engineering Standards Committee, I translate complex technical decisions into clear narratives that drive cross-functional alignment. My sales training investment, recognizing that technical excellence alone doesn't create organizational change, has proven essential for securing stakeholder buy-in and socializing vision across business units.

**Versatile Problem Solver**  
When team attrition created gaps, I stepped into product and project management roles, balancing competing priorities using frameworks like RACI matrices to maintain velocity while delivering strategic outcomes. I architect integrations across disparate systems (GitLab, GitHub, Figma, multiple Artifactory instances, CI pipelines) and evaluate build vs. buy tradeoffs with data-driven rigor.

## Key Achievements

**Founded & Scaled Frontend Developer Experience Infrastructure**  
I recognized an unarticulated organizational need to manage the complexity of frontend engineering operations and seized the opportunity to enable engineers by removing friction in their workflows, from centralized documentation to AI-enabled design-to-code handoff and automated accessibility violation remediation.

**Pioneered AI-Driven Quality Workflows**  
Led R&D on AI-driven workflows, integrating MCP servers with Cursor and GitHub Copilot to create quality-controlled LLM code generation.

**Architected Scalable Design Systems**  
Led redesign of AI-optimized, multi-brand design system with self-service adoption platform. Designed interface-first TypeScript architecture and leveraged LLMs to accelerate Vue and React implementation, maintaining velocity despite team attrition. Architected Nx monorepo enforcing platform-wide quality standards, enabling scalable delivery with core maintainers and inner-source contributors.

**Built & Developed High-Performing Teams**  
Hired senior and junior software engineers and led technical interviews with candidates across the engineering organization. Designed and led multi-year upskilling program based on identified skill gaps in technical and soft skills. Established technical knowledge sharing program organization-wide, creating a culture of continuous learning and growth.

## What Drives Me

I believe intelligent automation, when thoughtfully designed with human needs at the center, amplifies creativity and strategic thinking rather than replacing it. My mission is to reduce friction, eliminate context switching, and enable people to focus on work that matters. I've experienced firsthand how the right tools and workflows can transform organizational effectiveness.

I'm passionate about building smarter tools, seamless workflows, and data-driven experiences that reimagine how teams collaborate and create value.
