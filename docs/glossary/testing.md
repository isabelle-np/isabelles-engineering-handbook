# Glossary
## Testing
Us techies love our terms and acronyms! Throughout my career, I've encountered and learned numerous technical terms that I use regularly but have never formally documented or explained. This glossary serves as both a reference document for others and an exercise for me in teaching, challenging me to explain complex concepts succinctly and clearly.

### Testing Techniques
#### Snapshot Testing
Snapshot Testing is a technique where the output of a component is captured and compared to a saved snapshot. It helps detect unintended changes in the UI.

#### A/B Testing
A/B Testing is a method of comparing two versions of a feature or design to determine which performs better. It is commonly used in user experience optimization.

#### Smoke Testing
Smoke Testing is a preliminary test to check the basic functionality of an application. It ensures that the critical features are working before further testing.

### Metrics and Coverage
#### Code Coverage
Code Coverage is a metric that measures the percentage of code executed during testing. It helps identify untested parts of a codebase.

### Tools and Frameworks
#### Jest
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It is widely used for testing React applications and supports features like mocking and snapshot testing.

#### Mocha
Mocha is a JavaScript testing framework that provides a flexible and extensible environment for writing tests. It is often used with assertion libraries like Chai.

#### Chai
Chai is an assertion library for JavaScript that works with testing frameworks like Mocha. It provides a variety of assertion styles for writing tests.

### Testing Concepts
#### Test Doubles
Test Doubles are objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in tests. They include mocks, stubs, and spies.

#### Feature Flags
Feature Flags are a technique to enable or disable features in an application without deploying new code. They allow for controlled rollouts and experimentation.

#### Canary Deployment
Canary Deployment is a release strategy where a new version of an application is rolled out to a small subset of users before a full release. It helps identify issues early.
